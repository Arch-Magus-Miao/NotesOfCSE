1. Propositional logic
	(1) Defination
			a. Proposition
				a statement or assertion that expresses a judgment or opinion.
				Ex. p <-> q
			b. Truth table
			c. Tautology
				always true
			d. Contradiction
				always false
			e. Contingency
				it depends
	(2) Determine whether the proposition is tautology, contradiction, or contingency.
	(3) Write down the logical negation if compound proposition.
	
2. Set theory
	(1) Set donated by symbols: (N, Z, Q, R, empty)
	(2) Set builder notation (generator in python)
		Ex. {x: x^2 = 16}
	(3) Define cardinality: length of set.
	(4) Define intersection, union and difference of sets.
	(5) 略
	(6) Power set: all children of a set.
	(7) If |A| = n, |Pow(A)| = ?
	(8) Use Venn-Diagram
	
3. Predicate Logic/ First order logic
	(1) Define necessary Universes of Discourse.
	(2) Define predicates and write the English statement using symbolic notation.
	(3) Write the negation of the symbolic notation, and simplify
	(4) Rewrite the negation in English.
	
	Ex. Everybody needs somebody.
		(a) Let P be the set of people.
		(b) Define Need(x,y)=“xneedsy”. ∀x∈P ∃y∈P, Need(x,y).
		(c) ∃x∈P ∀y∈P, ¬Need(x,y).
		(d) There is someone who doesn’t need anybody.
		
4. Asmptotic notation
	(1) Define Big O (O()), Big Omega (Ω()), Big Theta (Θ()).
	(2) Limit Theorem
		lim(n->+∞) f(n)/g(n) > 0: f= Ω(g) 
		lim(n->+∞) f(n)/g(n) < +∞: f= O(g)
	(3) Use L'Hopital's Rule to evaluate limit, and mark out it.
	
5. Analysis of for and while loops
	(1) Find close expression for the run time of a simple algorithm.
